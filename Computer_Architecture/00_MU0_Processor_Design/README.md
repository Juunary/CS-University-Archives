# MU0 Processor Design

## Overview

A project designing and analyzing the MU0 educational processor using Logisim. MU0 is the Manchester University 0 processor, featuring a very simple ISA for learning computer architecture.

## MU0 Architecture Features

- 16-bit instructions / 12-bit address space
- Instruction Set: LDA, STO, ADD, SUB, JMP, JGE, JNE, STP
- Registers: ACC (Accumulator), PC (Program Counter)
